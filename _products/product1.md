For the more than 43 million sufferers of arthritis and similar afflictions, a safe, effective, natural method for reversing such diseases without drugs or potentially harmful side effects.

When veteran health writer Ellen Hodgson Brown found herself suffering from an arthritic hip so painful that sleep was almost impossible, she did not surrender to painkillers or replacement surgery. Instead, she undertook extensive investigation into natural remedies and schools of alternative medicine and devised an eclectic home protocol of fasting and nutritional healing. The result: the arthritis disappeared completely, leaving her feeling better than she had in years.

In Healing Joint Pain Naturally, Brown shares what she's learned in her journey to renewed wellness, in the process proving that the course of arthritis can be reversed. She first investigates the causes of joint disease, examining the roles of stress, poor nutrition, and energy blockage. She then covers the therapeutic possibilities of altered diet and detoxification; supplementation therapies of natural substances that offer safer pain relief without long-term side effects and that promote healing; and regulation therapies, ranging from exercise, massage, and chiropractic to chelation, homeopathy, and acupuncture. Her belief throughout is that healing is a natural process that can be promoted more by respecting the wisdom of the body than by waging war. Inspiring, wide-ranging, eclectic, Healing Joint Pain Naturally brings a message of hope and bodily renewal to millions who have resigned themselves to a life of pain.
